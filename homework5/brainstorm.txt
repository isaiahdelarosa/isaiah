2.  Exoplanet Detection: NASA Expolanet Archive database
    This provides known exoplanets and exoplanet candidates.

    Gravitational Wave Astronomy: Gravitational Wave Open Science Center(GWOSC)
    This provides data from gravitational wave detectors and provides strain data for confirmed events.

    Fractal Geometry: Mandelbrot Set explorer interactive online tool that allows for examination of the fractal image's intricate patterns. 

3. For Exoplanet detection/analysis, I can uses Python to filter through planets by their characteristics and analyzing light curves.
    We can examine radius, orbital period, temperature, transit depth. 
    I can also visualize data using matplotlib, and of course loops, lists, and conditionals.

Ambitious:
Use light curve data for stars that don't have a known planet. Use an algorithm to search all data for possible periodic signals/dips. Check the strongest signal and determine if it is a transit. Calculate period, planet radius.

Simpler:
Download and examine known light curve data for a confirmed exoplanet. Use Matplotlib to clean data and create a clear dip to show the planet's existence through visuals.
